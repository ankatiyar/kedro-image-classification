# Kedro Tutorial: Image Classification

This Kedro project demonstrates how to use Kedro for image classification tasks. For this tutorial, we'll be using the [Ships in Satellite Imagery dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhammell/ships-in-satellite-imagery). The dataset contains 4000 images in total, with 1000 images containing ships(positive class) and 3000 images not containing ships or partially containing ships(negative class).

## Setup

1. Clone this project locally
2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download the [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhammell/ships-in-satellite-imagery) and place it in the `data/01_raw` directory
